# Soar Engine Naming Convention Checker for C++

Improve your code quality with **Visual Studioâ€™s Unreal Engine Naming Convention Checker**! This tool helps ensure your C++ symbols conform to the Unreal Engine coding style by providing real-time feedback.

## How It Works
After adding an `.editorconfig` file to your Unreal Engine project, Visual Studio will:
- Display naming convention warnings in the **Error List**.
- Offer a **Quick Fix** option when you right-click the warning.

## Configuration
To customize how Visual Studio treats these checks (Warnings vs. Suggestions):
1. Go to **Tools > Options > Text Editor > C/C++ > Code Style > Linter**.
2. Change the setting for **Naming Convention (experimental)** to your preference.
